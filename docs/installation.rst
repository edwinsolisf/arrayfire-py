ArrayFire Installer
===================

Installing ArrayFire couldn't be easier. Navigate to https://arrayfire.com/download and download the appropriate installer for the target architecture and operating system. Although ArrayFire can be `built from source <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-python/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#arrayfire-python-bindings>`_, the installers conveniently package necessary dependencies.

Install the latest device drivers before using ArrayFire. Drivers and runtimes should be downloaded and installed from each device vendor's website.

Once the ArrayFire has been downloaded, run the installer.

The installer offers the option to automatically add ArrayFire to the path for all users. If the installer did not do this, simply append :literal:`%AF_PATH%/lib` to the PATH variable so that the loader can find ArrayFire DLLs.

There are two ways to install ArrayFire on Linux.

Package Manager
Using the ArrayFire Linux Installer
As of today, approach (1) is only supported for Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. Please go through the GitHub wiki `page <https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire/wiki/Install-ArrayFire-From-Linux-Package-Managers>`_ for detailed instructions.

For approach (2), once the ArrayFire installer is downloaded, execute the installer from the terminal as shown below. Set the :literal:`--prefix` argument to the target install directory; we recommend :literal:`/opt`.

.. code-block:: text

    ./ArrayFire_*_Linux_x86_64.sh --include-subdir --prefix=/opt

Given sudo permissions, the ArrayFire libraries can be added to the path via :literal:`ldconfig` like so:

.. code-block:: text

    echo /opt/arrayfire/lib64 > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/arrayfire.conf
    sudo ldconfig

Otherwise, the :literal:`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable can be set so that the shared library loader can find the ArrayFire libraries.

Graphics support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ArrayFire enables high-performance visualizations via the `Forge <https://github.com/arrayfire/forge>`_ library. On Linux, there are a few dependencies to install to enable graphics support:

* FreeImage
* Fontconfig
* GLU (OpenGL Utility Library)

To install these dependencies on common Linux distributions:

**Debian, Ubuntu (14.04 and above), and other Debian derivatives**

.. code-block:: text

   apt install build-essential libfreeimage3 libfontconfig1 libglu1-mesa
  

**Fedora, Redhat, CentOS**

.. code-block:: text

    yum install freeimage fontconfig mesa-libGLU


.. _macOS:

macOS
*****

Once the ArrayFire installer has been downloaded, execute the installer by either double-clicking on the ArrayFire :literal:`pkg` file or running the following command:

.. code-block:: text

    sudo installer -pkg Arrayfire-*_OSX.pkg -target /

NVIDIA Tegra devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ArrayFire is capable of running TX2 devices.

Before installing ArrayFire, make sure the latest version of JetPack (v2.3 and above) or L4T (v24.2 and above) is installed.

Tegra prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following dependencies are required for Tegra devices:

.. code-block:: text

    sudo apt install libopenblas-dev liblapacke-dev

Testing installation
********************

After ArrayFire is finished installing, we recommend building and running a few of the provided examples to verify things are working as expected.

On Windows, open the CMakeLists.txt file from CMake-GUI. Once the project is configured and generated, build and run the examples from Visual Studio.

On Linux, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: text

    cp -r /opt/arrayfire/share/ArrayFire/examples /tmp/examples
    cd /tmp/examples
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./helloworld/helloworld_{cpu,cuda,oneapi,opencl}
