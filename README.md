# arrayfire-py (WIP)
<p align="center"><a href="http://arrayfire.com/"><img src="http://arrayfire.com/logos/arrayfire_logo_whitebkgnd.png" width="800"></a></p>

[ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire) is a high performance library for parallel computing with an easy-to-use API. It enables users to write scientific computing code that is portable across CUDA, OpenCL and CPU devices.  

This project is a **work in progress**. It is meant to provide a numpy-like Python interface for the ArrayFire C library, i.e, it provides array functionality, math operations, printing, etc. This is the front-end python library for using ArrayFire. It is currently supported on Python 3.10+.

Here is an example of the library at work:
```py
# Set backend and device (optional: 'cuda', 'opencl', 'oneapi', 'cpu')
af.setBackend(af.BackendType.cuda)
af.setDevice(0)

# Create two 5x5 arrays on the GPU
a = af.randu((5, 5))
b = af.randu((5, 5))

# Perform element-wise addition and matrix multiplication
c = a + b
d = af.matmul(a, b)

# Print the result
print(c, "Element-wise Sum")
print(d, "Matrix Product")
```

# Installing

**Requirement Details**
This project is separated into 3 different parts:
```
arrayfire-py -> arrayfire-binary-python-wrapper -> ArrayFire C Libraries
```
This means that arrayfire with python each of these parts is needed:
- [`arrayfire-py`](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-py) is the `thin` wrapper that provides the numpy-like interface to execute math and array operations. *** This is the intended User Interface ***
- [`arrayfire-binary-python-wrapper`](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-binary-python-wrapper) is the `binary` wrapper that provides rough direct access to the functions in the C library.
- [`ArrayFire C Libraries`](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire) are the binaries obtained from compiling the [ArrayFire C/C++ Project](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire)

**Install the last stable version of python wrapper:**
```sh
pip install arrayfire_binary_python_wrapper-0.8.0+af3.10.0-py3-none-linux_x86_64.whl # install required binary wrapper with the 3.10 ArrayFire binaries included 
pip install arrayfire-py # install arrayfire python interface library
```

**Install a pre-built wheel:**
```
pip install arrayfire-py -f https://repo.arrayfire.com/python/wheels/arrayfire-py/0.1.0
```

# Building
Building this interface is straight forward using [scikit-build-core](https://github.com/scikit-build/scikit-build-core):
```
python -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
python -m build --wheel
```

**Note: Building this project does not require the arrayfire-binary-python-wrapper package; however, the binary wrapper is needed to run any projects with it**

# Running Tests

Tests are located in folder [tests](tests).

To run the tests, use:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/
```

# Contributing

If you are interested in using ArrayFire through python, we would appreciate any feedback and contributions.

The community of ArrayFire developers invites you to build with us if you are
interested and able to write top-performing tensor functions. Together we can
fulfill [The ArrayFire
